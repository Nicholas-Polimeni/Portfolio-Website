                            <p><b>>ABOUT</b><br>`I am a first-year student and Create-X Scholar at the Georgia Institute of Technology 
                            studying Electrical Engineering.`` I'm originally from Freehold, New Jersey. I'm interested 
                            in applying technology in public policy and social entrepreneurship, with the goal of 
                            creating a more sustainable, equitable world.`` For the past 2 years, I've been an environmental 
                            advocate with Citizens' Climate Lobby (CCL). I've lobbied on Capitol Hill for policy responses 
                            to climate changeâ€” specifically the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act (HR763).`` At Tech, 
                            I'm a Campus Leader for CCL and lead the chapter on campus. Some of our projects can be found 
                            below, in the "projects" section;`` our two main initiatives are addressing Georgia's high 
                            low-income energy burden, and using data analytics to improve social media political messaging. 
                            ``With CCL, I have also co-authored a policy memo to the Wisconsin Climate Task Force, created by 
                            Governor Evers, regarding suggested policies for modernizing their energy grid using emissions 
                            and generation data. I also highlighted the impact of data on revealing inequalities in 
                            high-pollution areas vs low-pollution areas.`` At Tech, I'm also a researcher in the Urban 
                            Research Group of Dr. Brian Y An in the School of Public Policy.`</p>

                            <p><b>>PROJECTS / RESEARCH</b><br>`Analyzing current social media trends using Python to determine the effectiveness of different 
                            types of political messaging regarding climate change. Data collection was performed by a Python 
                            web-scraper I created using Reddit's PRAW API.`` This was my first web scraper; I learned this 
                            utilization of Python in tandem with learning HTML/CSS and a bit of JSON. Learning both together, 
                            in the context of this project, was beneficial as knowledge of each was required to create a 
                            working interface between them.`` While Reddit was the first website I collected data from, I am 
                            planning to collect data from Twitter, as well. Both Reddit and Twitter are the most useful 
                            platforms for data analytics, as posts are tagged by topic, type, etc.`` The initial data collected 
                            from Reddit is 200 "top" and "hot" posts from the past month in political subreddits and their 
                            characteristics.`</p>
