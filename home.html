                        <p>I am a first-year student and Create-X Scholar at the Georgia Institute of Technology studying 
                        Electrical Engineering. I'm originally from Freehold, New Jersey. I'm interested in applying technology 
                        in public policy and social entrepreneurship, with the goal of creating a more sustainable, equitable world. 
                        For the past 2 years, I've been an environmental advocate with Citizens' Climate Lobby (CCL). I've lobbied 
                        on Capitol Hill for policy responses to climate changeâ€” specifically the Energy Innovation and Carbon 
                        Dividend Act (HR763). At Tech, I'm a Campus Leader for CCL and lead the chapter on campus. Some of our 
                        projects can be found below, in the "projects" section; our two main initiatives are addressing Georgia's 
                        high low-income energy burden, and using data analytics to improve social media political messaging. 
                        With CCL, I have also co-authored a policy memo to the Wisconsin Climate Task Force, created by Governor Evers, 
                        regarding suggested policies for modernizing their energy grid using emissions and generation data. I also 
                        highlighted the impact of data on revealing inequalities in high-pollution areas vs low-pollution areas.</p>
